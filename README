The Wikimedia Foundation operates some of the largest collaboratively edited
reference projects in the world, including Wikipedia. Our infrastructure powers
some of the most highly-trafficked sites on the web, serving content in over a
hundred languages to more than half a billion people each month. We use the Puppet
to manage our server configuration.

Welcome to our Puppet repository!

and a vibrant community of volunteer contributors. Get involved!
